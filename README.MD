# GLS Schedule Assistant

## About
This web Application was written during my Summer 2016 internship at Global Linking Solutions. This app is essentially a streamlined google calendars, allowing for basic calendar features as well as "group" functionality for increased company communication. This event follows the CRUD model and is written in PHP using the Yii2 framework / postgresql backend.
